PMG for the homies

[My Notes](notes.md)

Users will be able to create goals and organize them into customized categories. They can choose to make their goals public or prive, public goals can be seen by anyone and poeple can leave hearts and encouragement. Users can friend each other whitch will allow access to create goals together and allow users to read eachothers' progress journals (victories, discouragements, whatever the user writes). Measument of a goal brings improvement, with accountability and positive feedback, the rate of improvement accelerates. 

> [!NOTE]
> This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

> If you are not familiar with Markdown then you should review the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) before continuing.

> [!NOTE]
> Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [] Description of key features
- [] Description of how you will use each technology
- [] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

A place where users can make measurable goals and collaborate on larger goals with friends. Users can recieve positive feedback on their progress from stangers if they choose to make thier goal public and they can recieve written feedback from friends on all of thier goals. As a user completes goals, interacts with others, or makes friends, they make points that they can then spend to buy cool accessories for their avatar.
